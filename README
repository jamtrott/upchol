This is the README file for upchol, which is a program for computing
Cholesky factorizations of symmetric, positive definite, sparse
matrices. The algorithm implemented in upchol is based on an uplooking
Cholesky factorisation.

Building
--------

The upchol program can be built with `make'. Compilation and linking
can be configured through the environment variable `CC', which is used
to choose a compiler, and `CFLAGS' and `LDFLAGS', which are used to
set compiler flags and linker flags, respectively. Here is an example:

     make CC=gcc CFLAGS="-O3 -march=native"


Usage
-----

The program upchol loads a matrix from a Matrix Market file (see
https://math.nist.gov/MatrixMarket/formats.html), converts it to
compressed sparse row (CSR) format, and then performs the Cholesky
factorisation. More specifically, a matrix A is decomposed into a
product A=LL' of a lower triangular matrix L, called the Cholesky
factor, and its (upper triangular) transpose L'. The Cholesky factor L
is then output in Matrix Market file format.

The following is a basic example:

    $ ./upchol test.mtx
    %%MatrixMarket matrix coordinate real general

It is sometimes desirable to only obtain the sparsity pattern of the
Cholesky factor L, instead of performing a full numerical
factorisation. This is done with the option `--symbolic'. The output
is then a binary matrix in Matrix Market format with the same nonzero
pattern as the Cholesky factor L.

    $ ./upchol test.mtx --symbolic
    %%MatrixMarket matrix coordinate pattern general
    11 11 33
    1 1
    2 2

Furthermore, in some cases, it may be convenient to suppress the
output of the Cholesky factor itself, while displaying some more
information about the factorisation procedure. For example:

    $ ./upchol test.mtx --verbose -q --verify
    read matrix: 0.000710 seconds (0.3 MB/s)
    convert to csr: 0.000003 seconds, 11 rows, 11 columns, 27 nonzeros, 1 to 6 nonzeros per row
    allocating storage for cholesky factorisation: 0.000003 seconds, 0.004 MB initial allocation for cholesky factor
    cholesky factorisation: 0.000005 seconds, 5.356 Mnz/s, 0.000 Mflop/s, 33 nonzeros, 6 fill-in (nonzeros), 1.375 fill-ratio, 0.003 MB unused
    verifying results - counting nonzeros in B=LL': 0.000243 seconds
