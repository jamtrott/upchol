This is the README file for upchol, which is a program for computing
Cholesky factorizations of symmetric, positive definite, sparse
matrices. The algorithm implemented in upchol is based on an uplooking
Cholesky factorisation.

Building
--------

The upchol program can be built with `make'. Compilation and linking
can be configured through the environment variable `CC', which is used
to choose a compiler, and `CFLAGS' and `LDFLAGS', which are used to
set compiler flags and linker flags, respectively. Here is an example:

     make CC=gcc CFLAGS="-O3 -march=native"


Usage
-----

The program upchol loads a matrix from a Matrix Market file (see
https://math.nist.gov/MatrixMarket/formats.html), converts it to
compressed sparse row (CSR) format, and then performs the Cholesky
factorisation. More specifically, a matrix A is decomposed into a
product A=LL' of a lower triangular matrix L, called the Cholesky
factor, and its (upper triangular) transpose L'. The Cholesky factor L
is then output in Matrix Market file format.

The following is a basic example:

    $ ./upchol --verbose test.mtx
    mtxfile_read: 32.034946 seconds (99.7 MB/s)
    csr_from_coo: 0.772920 seconds, 6,810,586 rows, 115,779,962 nonzeros, 16 nonzeros per row
    gemv16: 0.011727 seconds (9.5 Gnz/s, 19.7 Gflop/s, 125.4 GB/s)

It is sometimes desirable to only obtain the sparsity pattern of the
Cholesky factor L, instead of performing a full numerical
factorisation. This is done with the option `--symbolic'. The output
is then a binary matrix in Matrix Market format with the same nonzero
pattern as the Cholesky factor L.
